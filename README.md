# GUI Covid Tracker

Mini project that allows us to see the stats about Covid-19 virus based on the conutry we set as an input.

Tip - When you want to run this application, first install libraries listed later in readme file. If you want to see the code, don't open only covid19.py with your editor. Open the whole location directory in your editor. If you don't it is possible that you get an error about missing 'images' directory.

Libraries used:
- matplotlib ( install by typing 'pip install matplotlib' in cmd / powershell )
- covid ( install by typing 'pip install covid' in cmd / powershell )
- PIL ( install by typing 'pip install pillow' in cmd / powershell )
- tkinter ( built-in )

To Do:
- Add comments
- Organize code better
- Make better looking gui:
  + Add some kind of menu
  + Add a drop list of frequently used countries to choose from
  + Change pictures ( add some images that make more sense )

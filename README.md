# GUI Covid Tracker

Mini project that allows us to see the stats about Covid-19 virus based on the conutry we set as an input.

To Do:
- Add comments
- Organize code better
- Make better looking gui:
  + Add some kind of menu
  + Add a drop list of frequently used countries to choose from
  + Change pictures ( add some images that make more sense )
